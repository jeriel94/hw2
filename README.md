# ENTR-451 Assignment #2
Now that we know how to connect our ruby code (in a Rails app) to our SQL database, let's rewrite the previous assignment in ruby.  You'll be using the domain model from _[hw1](hw1-solution.sql)_ to create the database structure for "KMDB" (the Kellogg Movie Database). The end product will be a report that prints the movies and the top-billed cast for each movie in the database.

### Getting Started
- Complete the assignment per the detailed instructions found in the comments of _[kmdb.rb](kmdb.rb)_, executing the script by using the `rails runner kmdb.rb` command.
